# My Portfolio Website

This website is a portfolio for me to showcase and display any projects and achievements that I complete along my coding Journey. This Website has information about me, my experience and education, My Development and Soft Skills as well as a section where you can contact me.

This portfolio allows potential recruiters to see everything that they need to know about me and my experience, which allows them to see whether or not they wish to recruit me.

## Features

- ### Navigation
  - Featured at the top right of the website is a navigation Bar. For a better design the navigation bar does not follow the user as they scroll. This allows the user to always be able to see all of the text and images.
  - On the Right side of the website, starting after the hero section, are arrows which point down, these arrows allow the user to click to see the whole website. Each arrow links to the next section in the website and stops at the _perfect_ place for the user to see   everything.
  - The navigation is in font which was chosen to be apealing and modern. This allows for the website to look better to a wider audience of people.
  - The navigation bar clearly shows the names of the sections which allows for people to be able to quickly navigate to the section that they want

- ### Header Section
-   The header section clearly displays my name as well as shows a picture of me, The text uses multiple elements to draw the users eye to specific sections.
-   The colors of the text are also different to draw the users attention, but also to juxtapose the image next to it, allowing it to pop more to the user.
-   The Header section also has 2 buttons which allows you to either download my CV or to go straight to the contact me page. Both buttons were extensively tested and they work perfectly.

## Bugs

- When I first deployed the website the pictures did not load properly.
- I discovered that this was because the images were saved to my computer only.
- I then uploaded all images that I needed to [freehost](https://freeimage.host/) which allowed me to use the images that I wanted.
