My Portfolio Website

This website is a portfolio for me to showcase and display any projects and achievements that I complete along my coding Journey. This Website has information about me, my experience and education, My Development and Soft Skills as well as a section where you can contact me.

This portfolio allows potential recruiters to see everything that they need to know about me and my experience, which allows them to see whether or not they wish to recruit me.
